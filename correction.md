Good job!:)

For removing an element, you just need to select the element you want to delete and use the remove function: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_element_remove.asp

To get the parent element of another element (target in your case) you can do this: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_node_parentelement.asp
